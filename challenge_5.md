# Challenge Problem
These are my two "mapviews" of the country of Gabon.  The first graph shows the adm1 subset and the second shows the adm2 subset.

# Sum Investigation & Comparison
Of the three sets of plots, the non-log sums of the population produced the most accurate prediction in my opinion.  The estimated population according to this analysis was off by only several hundred individuals.

NOTE:  Some of the visualizations have taken on a "spiky" or "spotted" pattern.  The TAs suggested that these artifacts are a result of errors in the data rather than in my code.  I did my best to resolve the issue, but it has remained.  I included them to show that I was able to construct the code properly.

This are the three maps that show the analysis of the summing of the adm2 layer.

# Mean Investigation & Comparison
This are the three maps that show the analysis of the means of the adm2 layer.

# LogPop Investigation & Comparison
This are the three maps that show the analysis of the logarithm of the populations of the adm2 layer.
