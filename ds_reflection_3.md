Question #1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?

Owen Barder defines development as the product of the economic and social system of a country and not just the sum of the well-being of the people in it.  He extends Sen’s definition to include looking at traditional economic models – models based on the idea that development is a gradual process of firms becoming more productive and increasing household income.  This creates the opportunities given in Sen’s definition.

Question #2: What was the toaster project?  What did Thomas Thwaites attepmpts to do? Was he successful?  What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?

The toaster project was the attempt to construct a toaster completely from scratch.  Thwaites was somewhat successful in making the toaster from raw materials (smelting iron ore, creating plastic, etc), but upon plugging it in, it burst into flames.  Had his goal been to make a toaster that toasted itself, it would have been a grand success.  In this context of complexity, where we must consider the economic and social organization of a country, objects deemed mundane in the developed world are nearly impossible to make in developing countries without a sufficiently advanced economy and proper political infrastructure.  Thus, many countries are trapped in a rut.

Question #3: According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?

A prominent economic model is the Harrod-Domar growth model.  It claims sufficient capital and workforce volume would increase output, thereby accelerating development.  However, this model does not function well and fails to explain differences in development among countries.  However, the Neoclassical growth model extends the Harrod-Domar model to include “exogenous technical change”.  This component is nebulous, but when applied to the Harrod-Domar model, it fits data much better.  In summary, no economic model has been able to accurately explain deficiencies/accelerations in development, leading to a circle of blame on different institutions, such as policy, management, and corruption.

Question #4:  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever?  Was he successful?  How significant were his results?

Steve Jones was an evolutionary biologist.  Prior to his scientific career, he worked at Uni-Lever making soap.  He was hired to design a nozzle to improve soap manufacturing.  To do this, he essentially applied a rudimentary form of natural selection: he would randomly distort the nozzle, find the one that worked the best, and perform this recursively.  His method resulted in a nozzle that was several times better than the initial one.

Question #5: What is a complex adaptive system?  What are some of its important features?

A complex adaptive system is the dynamic interaction of many components that behave in a way that is generally unpredictable.  Some important features of these systems include:
1.	They are all impossible or incredibly difficult to predict in detail.
2.	Broad predictions about a complex system can be made.
3.	They have emergent properties, meaning that patterns arise from these systems that are not apparent in its component interactions.
4.	These systems tend towards great complexity.
5.	These systems to not tend towards equilibrium.

Question #6: Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of “The Emperor” exemplify the suppression of emergent systematic change?

Haile Sellasie was the emperor of the last feudal dynasty of Ethiopia.  During his reign, every decision and action was resulted from his order.  He derived power from having total control of his country and maintaining its economic organization, so any attempt by Ethiopian citizens to adapt were quickly squashed.

Question #7:  Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implementation?  What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?

Based on past precedent, attempting to engineer solutions to complex problems often results in failure.  Utilizing a pseudo-evolutionary process has the advantage of naturally adapting to fit its particular and ever-changing socioeconomic and political environment.
Iso-morphic mimicry is the brute-force implementation of institutions deemed as internationally successful in developing countries.  This practice often results in institutions that are detached from their environment and lack the ability to adapt.

Question #8:  What does Barder mean by “resist fatalism”?  Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

Barder is saying that we do not have to accept the direction and outcome of evolution since we have the ability to shape them.  Norman Bourlag bred high-yield, disease resistant wheat varieties.  From this directed evolution, it is estimated that Bourlag has saved more than a billion lives from succumbing to starvation.
