The usage of data science in extending humanitarian aid promises novel ways to model international development.  In Blumenstock’s article, he details the promise of using everyday technology to visualize impoverished populations in developing countries.  Patterns arise from mobile phone usage that are consistent with the different activities available to different economic groups.  For example, researchers correlated making international phone calls and having more Facebook friends (implying a wealthier circle of friends) with the ability to pay off debts on time.  Additionally, machine learning algorithms can identify credit scores for people with mobile phones that do not have access to financial institutions (implying poverty).  Recent studies have shown algorithms developed by large companies, such as Google and Facebook, to match consumers with targeted advertisements can be tailored to match resources to impoverished people.  High-resolution satellite imagery can be used to mark key identifiers of wealth disparities such as living in a house with a thatch roof versus one with an iron roof.  These resources should allow governments to focus aid efforts in a much more efficient way than they do now, but these methods have major obstacles.

One of the problems with these methods are the unanticipated effects: the power to extract solutions from data often lies in the hands of the wealthy rather than the poor, leading to worsening conditions due to ignorance.  The article provides an example of a well-known financial relief effort: microloans.  Microloans are small sums of money that are distributed using mobile phones.  While thousands of loans are made per day in sub-Saharan Africa alone, the borrowers are often unaware of the terms they are offered.  This leads to debt-repayment cycles that plunge people into an even deeper financial hole.

While modern data collection is cheaper and faster, their inaccuracies are not well understood.  Results derived from these tools may influence policymaking decisions before they have been validated.  Additionally, the algorithms cannot account for month-by-month changes that are intrinsic to developing countries, leading to false representation.  Lastly, when the population of a country becomes aware of the mechanisms behind aid eligibility determination, many will cheat them.  For example, with the knowledge that satellite imagery is heavily used, some people will pretend to live in a thatch-roofed house instead of their more expensive iron-roofed one.

Tools trained on data that can only be collected from a certain population, so they marginalize the most vulnerable.  When mobile phones cannot be afforded, this also means that electricity, literacy, and connectivity likely cannot be afforded either.  While these are people that should be prioritized in aid efforts, they are relatively unaccounted for.  People with mobile phones are, to some degree, better off and will receive the aid due to being able to afford a mobile phone.

While these may be significant impediments, the article provides some ways of fixing these problems.  1) Do not discard old sources of data.  Since they have proven to be more reliable, use them as benchmarks for evaluating newer collection systems.  2) Instead of “re-inventing the wheel” and attempting to develop new algorithms, customize already existing algorithms to carry out the required tasks.  Blumenstock and his colleagues are actively employing this mindset by partnering with a company that improves the microloan system in Africa.  3)  A tremendous amount of technological innovation originates from Silicon Valley.  These companies are driven by profit, however, and having them addressing development challenges cannot be a low priority due to no payout.  A solution is fostering integrated collaboration among the many disciplines involved in these projects.  This would help Silicon Valley data scientists and software developers understand the crucial context of the problems that would be working on.

The three ideas presented by classmates are inextricably linked and failing to consider one aspect in relation to the others will lead to unsuccessful development initiatives.  Each of the above examples of initiatives or roadblocks each has a problem rooted in one of these factors.
	
1.	Good intent: The usage of mobile phones as a means to direct focused aid efforts, while rooted in good intentions, ignores an extremely vulnerable and at-risk demographic (paragraph 4).

2.	Transparency: The current microloan system, while a great idea in principle, fails to make the data that made it possible available and understood by the target demographic.  Due to the lack of provision of critical financial information/inability to effectively parse difficult terms, borrowers easily make situations worse for themselves (paragraph 2).

3.	Balancing: Many technologically advanced solutions can appear feasible during development, but failure to balance that with the specific context of the development challenge leads to superficial assistance.  From the article, a company attempted to distribute laptops to impoverished people around the world.  While certainly a nice thought, the company failed to consider other significant aspects inherent to each region of the world.
