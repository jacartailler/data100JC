# Justin Cartailler DATA 100 Repository

Welcome to my GitHub page.  Iâ€™m from Nashville and I plan on majoring in mathematical biology/chemistry.  I like metal, play guitar, and am a science fiction/cosmic horror junkie.  I am massively interested in biological research and have five years of formal academic laboratory experience.
