Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Provide an example.

  Fractal networks that govern the “pace of life”:  Constituents in a complex system, such as in the human body, are composed of networks that resemble fractals.  That is, observations made farther and farther into the system will reveal an almost infinite series of component networks.  For example, suppose we investigate the oxidation pathway of the mitochondria.  By seeking a higher-resolution understanding of its processes, we’d engage in a near-infinite exploration that may resemble understanding each different protein, those proteins’ involved pathways, the metabolic characteristics, and so forth.  The consequence of such composition is that these networks function as the rate-determining-steps.  In other words, growth only happens as fast as these constituent steps happen.  This phenomenon is easily related to societal development:  the “end” of this fractal is humans.  The actions carried out by people daily (labor, cultural interactions, etc.) wholly affect the development speed of a country/city.  Thus, this shows how large-scale social development is fundamentally tied to the operations of the individual.
  
  The three-fourths scaling law:  If you approached a random person and asked, “If I were to increase the size of the human, how much more energy would we need to function?”, they are most likely to answer that humans would require twice as much energy.  However, West explains that the three-fourths law takes over, and the answer is that we would most likely require only 75% more energy.  This concept is used to introduce the nonlinear dynamics intrinsic to scaling – increasing or decreasing the size of an entity does not respectively change its characteristics or needs as a direct relationship.  This rule has been observed in city development: a linear extrapolation was performed between Oklahoma City’s population growth and GDP to predict output at a higher population density.  When compared to Los Angeles, the prediction underestimated output by approximately 15%.  With the knowledge that scaling heavily implies and almost necessitates a nonlinear approach, future development analyses will likely be more accurate.
  
  Cities modeled as organisms:  Pondering these important factors as a result of scaling leads to a rather incredible realization: just as organisms can be considered variations on a hypothetical “average” organism, cities of varying sizes can be related in the same way.  In biology, as you consider the spectrum of small to large organisms, one finds that an elephant requires less energy per unit of weight than a mouse does.  Across the globe, as a city becomes larger, “fewer roads and electrical cables are required per capita”.  What this elegant observation in scaling tells us that researchers can apply scaling laws found in nature to city development and likely derive poignant conclusions. 
  
  West’s views regarding big data are quite similar to what I have learned through past internships and professional experiences.  I have witnessed people falling into the trap of herald big data as the solution to every conceivable problem – if we can fit a tremendous amount of data into a black-box computer and it produces something we like, then it must be so!  This is a dangerous mindset.  Without subjecting data and the tools to analyze them to intense scientific rigor, these blind assumptions can only lead to disaster.  Therefore, as West points out, big data should be viewed primarily through the scientific method, thoroughly interrogated, and whose predictions can be tested.  Additionally, he asserts that big data should be used to supplement theory and build our fundamental understanding.

  In my opinion, this “correlation supersedes causation” movement is what has led to the recent concerning idea to abandon theory.  To express my interpretation of West’s view through an example:
Imagine you are a nascent medical researcher seeking a cure to an enigmatic disease.  Instead of learning your physiology, anatomy, and medicine, you decide to design a “machine learning algorithm”.  You feed patient data into the algorithm and it suggests a therapeutic or way to mitigate the disease.  However, without knowing the theory behind the subject, how is it possible that you could ever truly know what you’re looking at and its potential consequences?  What if your program draws a correlation between a drug and a cellular receptor that could be deadly, but you did not catch it because you did not know the conceptual framework behind this type of interaction?   Algorithms are tools of analysis that are only as intelligent as the people who designed them.  Should a problem arise where simple correlational analysis is insufficient to provide a solution, what then?  People will not have the fundamental understanding of the theory of the problem and people will suffer for it.  Therefore, the talk of leaving theory behind is a silly one.
